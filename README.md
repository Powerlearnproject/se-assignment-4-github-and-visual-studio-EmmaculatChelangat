Version Control with Git:
Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
  Version control is a system that tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a project, track modifications, and revert to previous versions if necessary.
Key Concepts of Version Control in Git
1. Repository (Repo): A repository is the central storage for all files, along with their revision history.
2. Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes to the files and includes metadata like the author, timestamp, and a commit message.
3. Branch: A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase (often the main or master branch).
4. Merge: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. It helps combine different lines of development.
5. Clone: Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a repository. Developers can work on the project locally and later push their changes back to the remote repository.
6. Pull: Pulling is the act of fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository into the local repository.
7. Push: Pushing is the process of sending local commits to the remote repository, and updating it with changes made locally.
8. Remote: A remote is a reference to a repository hosted elsewhere, usually on a server or a service like GitHub.
How GitHub Enhances Version Control

Inside this directory, create a YAML file for the workflow, e.g., ci-cd-pipeline.yml.
Define the Workflow in the YAML File:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Define the jobs to run
jobs:
  build:
    # Define the runner environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps to execute in the job
    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Build the project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    # This job depends on the build job
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Deploy the project (this example uses a dummy deployment step)
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying project..."
